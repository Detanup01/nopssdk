### A tiny library that fully strips the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement for God of War Ragnarok.

## Why?

There is a number of people that encountered various unexpected errors and issues, e.g. a sudden error message popup and more.
This library attempts to resolve all the possible issues related to the PlayStation PC SDK.

## Notes

This project does not touch or modify any original game code and is NOT intended to encourage the piracy.

## Usage

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dandykong/nopssdk/releases/latest)
2. Copy the `version.dll` and `PsPcSdk.dll` to the game folder
3. Enjoy!

### Linux (Wine)

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dandykong/nopssdk/releases/latest)

## Troubleshooting:

If you still encounter the login screen error, make sure to remove this file first: 

- `C:\Users\[Username]\\Saved Games\God of War RagnarÃ¶k\[AccountID]\userpreferences`

Upon the first popup when it asks to link the Steam account, press `NO` button.
